  ## Installation
  First, in the integrated terminal in the right directory, run the command "npm init -y" and a pacakge.json file will be created. Next, install the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package by running the command "npm i inquirer@6.5.0" (I used Inquirer version 6.5.0 for the app). Once installed, User will be able to see the "inquirer" package added under the dependencies key in the package.json file. User will need the files index.js and generateMarkdown.js (in /utils folder) to run the application. 
  
  ## Usage
  To use the application, User run command "node index.js" in the integrated terminal. The application will ask a serie of questions such as the Project Name, Description, Details of Installation, Usage, Licences, Authors and others' contributions. The input will be formatted professionally and written in an output file called "README.md" in /output folder that the app creates.
